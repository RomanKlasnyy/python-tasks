Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was looking kind of dumb
With the finger and her thumb
In the shape of an 'L' on her forehead

Well, the years start coming
And the don't stop coming
And the don't stop coming
And the don't stop coming
And the don't stop coming
